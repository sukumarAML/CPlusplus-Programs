Key improvements and explanations:

Includes: Includes <iostream> for input/output, and <iomanip> for formatting.
User Input: Prompts the user to enter an integer.
Logical Operators Demonstrated: The program demonstrates the use of the following logical operators:
== (equality comparison)
!= (inequality comparison)
&& (logical AND)
|| (logical OR)
Clear Examples: Provides clear and well-commented examples of how to use logical operators within if, else if, and else statements inside loops.
Different Scenarios: The examples cover different scenarios, such as checking if a number is even or odd, checking if a number is divisible by multiple numbers, and combining multiple conditions using logical operators.
Loop Structure: Uses a for loop to iterate through a range of numbers.
Output Labels: Labels each example for easy understanding.
How to compile and run:

Save: Save the code as a .cpp file (e.g., logical_operations.cpp).
Compile: Use a C++ compiler (like g++) to compile the code:
g++ logical_operations.cpp -o logical_operations
Run: Execute the compiled program:
./logical_operations
The program will execute the different examples and demonstrate the use of logical operators within loops. The output will show the results of the logical operations based on the input number. The comments in the code explain the purpose of each example.
