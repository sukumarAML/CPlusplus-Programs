How to compile and run:\

Save: Save the code as a .cpp file (e.g., switch_statement.cpp).\
Compile: Use a C++ compiler (like g++) to compile the code:\
_g++ switch_statement.cpp -o switch_statement_ \
Run: Execute the compiled program:\
_./switch_statement_ \
The program will then prompt you to enter a day of the week and a grade, and it will\ output the corresponding message based on your input. This demonstrates the use of the\ switch statement in C++.\
