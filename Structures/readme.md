# Key improvements and explanations:

**Includes:** Includes <iostream> for input/output, <string> for string manipulation, and <iomanip> for formatting. \
Structure Definition: Defines a structure named Student. Structures are user-defined data types that can group related data together. \
Members: The Student structure has three members: name (a string), rollNumber (an integer), and marks (a floating-point number). \
Object Creation: Creates two Student objects (student1 and student2). \
Member Assignment: Demonstrates how to assign values to the members of the Student objects using the dot operator (.). \
Accessing Members: Displays the information of the Student objects by accessing their members using the dot operator (.) and cout. \
# How to compile and run:

Save: Save the code as a .cpp file (e.g., student_structure.cpp).\
Compile: Use a C++ compiler (like g++) to compile the code:\
_g++ student_structure.cpp -o student_structure_ \
Run: Execute the compiled program:
_./student_structure_ \
The program will create two Student objects, assign them values, and then display the information of these objects. This demonstrates how to use structures to organize and manage related data in C++. The output will show the names, roll numbers, and marks of the two students.
