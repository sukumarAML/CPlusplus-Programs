# Practice problems

## Basic problems
1.Write a C++ program to swap the first and last digits of any number. \
2.Write a C++ program that replaces all the words of "string1" with "string2". \
3.Write a C++ program to compute the sum of two given integer values. If the two values are the same, then return triple their sum. \
4.Write a C++ program to remove the character at a given position in the string. The given position will be in the range 0..n string length -1 inclusive. \
5.Write a C++ program to exchange the first and last characters in a given string and return the result string. \
6.Write a C++ program to check which number is closest to the value 100 among two given integers. Return 0 if the two numbers are equal. \
7.Write a C++ program to check whether two given integers are in the range [1,..,n] inclusive, or they are both in the range [1,..,n] inclusive. \
8.Write a C++ program to check if two given non-negative integers have the same last digit. \
9.Write a C++ program to create another string which is n copies of the first 3 characters of a given string. If the length of the given string is less than 3 then return n copies of the string. \
10. Write a C++ program to find the largest value from the first, last, and middle elements of a given array of integers of odd length (at least 1).
