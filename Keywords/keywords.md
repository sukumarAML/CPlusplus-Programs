# Keywords
Keywords in C++ are predefined, reserved words that have a special meaning to the compiler. They are fundamental building blocks of the language's syntax and cannot be used by programmers as identifiers (such as names for variables, functions, or classes). 
Each keyword performs a specific task, such as defining data types, controlling program flow, or managing access levels in object-oriented programming. As of the C++20 standard, there are 95 keywords. 
Key Characteristics
Reserved: Their meaning is predefined and cannot be changed or redefined.
Case-Sensitive: All C++ keywords must be written in lowercase.
Essential for Syntax: They are used to structure code and instruct the compiler on how to interpret and execute the program.
