# Key improvements and explanations:

**Includes:** Includes <iostream> for input/output, and <iomanip> for formatting.
Array Declaration and Initialization: Creates an array of integers called numbers with a size of 5 and initializes it with some values.
Printing the Array: Uses a for loop to iterate through the array and print each element.
Calculating the Sum: Uses a for loop to iterate through the array and calculate the sum of its elements.
Finding the Maximum Element: Uses a for loop to iterate through the array and find the maximum element.
Searching for an Element: Uses a for loop to search for a specific element within the array. It includes a break statement to exit the loop as soon as the element is found, improving efficiency. Also includes a bool found variable to clearly track whether the element was found.
Clear Output: The program provides clear output for each operation, making it easy to understand the results.
How to compile and run:

Save: Save the code as a .cpp file (e.g., array_operations.cpp).
Compile: Use a C++ compiler (like g++) to compile the code:
g++ array_operations.cpp -o array_operations
Run: Execute the compiled program:
./array_operations
This program demonstrates the basic operations you can perform on arrays in C++, including initialization, printing, calculating the sum, finding the maximum element, and searching for an element. This provides a solid foundation for understanding more advanced array techniques.
